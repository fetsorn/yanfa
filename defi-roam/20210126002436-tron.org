#+title: Tron

Tron is a decentralized blockchain platform that aims to develop a decentralized web. Like Ethereum, Tron allows dApp developers to create and leverage complete protocols via smart contracts on the blockchain.

The Tron platform can handle 2000 transactions per second, which put it on par as compared to major payment processors like Paypal. It has zero transaction fees.

Tron depends on the Delegated-Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism to secure the blockchain. A DPoS is similar to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that allows users to earn passive income whenever they stake their holdings in a network wallet.

Features of Tron Blockchain Network:
 - High Scalability
 - High Availability
 - High Throughput
 - Compatibility with EVM
 - Multi-language extension
 - Eliminating counterfeit chain
