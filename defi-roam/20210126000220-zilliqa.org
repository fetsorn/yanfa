With its own smart contract language scilla and being the first public Blockchain to implement sharding in its testnet, Zilliqa is a high-throughput blockchain platform that achieves over 2,828 transactions per second. Moreover, the scalable throughput ensures that Zilliqaâ€™s capacity can continue to grow with the growing number of nodes.
Additionally, I would like to mention 20 more Blockchain platforms which are currently being developed or are in the stage of early deployment.
