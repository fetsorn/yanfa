#+title: Tendermint

Tendermint is an Application BlockChain Interface(ABCI) which powers the Cosmos Blockchain platform. In any Blockchain, the basic requirement is of a consensus and the peer-to-peer network configurations but it is obvious that we donâ€™t need to develop these if we want to incorporate Blockchain in our business so Tendermint built an engine which works like an engine for a car. You have to design the layout and the purpose of the car with Cosmos and Tendermint will power it with its engine.
