#+title: smart contract languages

* Overview
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: overview
  :END:
This is a curated collection of resources on specialized programming
languages executed by decentralized peer-to-peer networks, also known as
blockchains.

Let us define a smart contract, or simply contract, as a piece of code
created by a blockchain user and executed by a blockchain node. A smart
contract language (SCL) is a programming language that is either used to
write a smart contract directly, or is compiled to it.

Programming languages differ on multiple dimensions, such as
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm][paradigm]] and
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system][type system]]. Due to a
very unusual execution environment, SCLs have a different set of
trade-offs compared to earlier languages. This spawned multiple attempts
at creating secure and expressive SCLs.
